# FastGrading
A step-by-step, from-scratch Optical Mark Recognition (OMR) project in Python using OpenCV — works on scanned images and realtime webcam scans.


About

This repo contains a complete OMR pipeline implemented from scratch in Python using OpenCV. The code is split so each step is small and explained line-by-line in the notebook/script comments. You start by processing images of solved MCQ sheets, and when that is stable, you enable the webcam mode for realtime scoring.

Features

Detect and align MCQ answer sheet automatically

Detect filled bubbles (dark marks) robustly

Support scanned/photographed images and realtime webcam scanning

Generates per-student score summary

Visual debug overlays showing detected contours, bubbles, and chosen answers

Step-by-step code with commentary (learn as you build)
